## Zutaten

- [ ] 2 cups short-grain brown rice
- [ ] 2 teaspoons neutral-tasting oil
- [ ] 1 cup diced shallots or onion
- [x] 1 1/2 Tablespoons minced fresh ginger 
- [x] 1 cup canned coconut milk
- [x] 2 1/2 cups vegetable broth
- [x] 1/4 teaspoon salt 
- [x] 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- [ ] 1 mango
- [ ] 2 cans cooked red beans
- [ ] Grated zest and juice of 1 lime
- [ ] Chopped cilantro or green onions 

## Zubereitung

- [x] Rinse the rice under cool water. Heat oil over medium heat in a large soup pot. Add the shallots or onion and saute until they start to brown in some spots, about 3 minutes. Add the ginger and saute for 30 seconds until everything smells choice. Add the rice and keep stirring until the rice starts to smell slightly toasted, about 2 minutes. Add the coconut milk, broth, salt, and cayenne pepper and bring to a simmer. Give the pot a quick stir, cover, and reduce heat to low. Simmer for about 40 minutes or until liquid is absorbed and rice is tender. If your rice isnâ€™t done by the time the liquid is absorbed, add a little more broth or water.
- [x] While the rice is cooking, chop up the mango into bite-size pieces.
- [ ] When the rice is tender, fold in the beans, lime zest, lime juice, and mango. Let cook for another minute or so until everything is warm. Serve topped with cilantro or green onions.
