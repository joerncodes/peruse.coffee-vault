A decomposing corpse bloats because of gases excreted by bacteria in the body. This is very pronounced in the abdomen, where a lot of bacteria can be found, but can also occur in other "hot spots". 

For example, in male corpses, it's not unusual for the penis and testicles to swell and become "very large", as large as a softball.
